            <p>Emily, me, 10 years ago, i was just like any other international students, came to America pursuing higher education and opportunities.  
            In the past 10 years, I was keep seeking my value and where do I belong. I graduated from Portland State University and majored in business administration. After that, I went back to China for a few years, and I was once an English teacher, personal finance manager, and a retail manager.</p>
            <p>Somehow, I missed my American life, so I decided to come back. This time when I decide to try something new, and somehow coding come in mind. I have no experience with any tech skills, but why not give myself another opportunity, or just some new knowledge. I ended up with enrolling a bookcamp,and so far, so good! </p>
